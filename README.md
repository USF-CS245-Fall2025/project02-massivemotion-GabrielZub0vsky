# MassiveMotion
CS 245 Project 02
----------------------------
__Project Goal:__ Implement four different list variants and use Java graphics to simulate a celestial system with a star and asteroids flying around it.
----------------------------
_Project Contents:_
* MassiveMotion.java (driver class)
* MMProperties.java (helper class to read and store values of properties)
* CelestialBody.java (helper class to create celestial bodies with attributes)
* List.java, Iterator.java (interfaces)
* MyArrayList.java, SingleLinkedList.java, DoubleLinkedList.java, DummyHeadList.java (list implementations)

Attached in the repo is also a screen recording (mp4) of my MassiveMotion simulation running.
